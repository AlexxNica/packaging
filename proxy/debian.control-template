Description:
 cc-proxy works alongside the Clear Containers runtime and shim to provide a VM-based OCI runtime solution.
 cc-proxy is a daemon offering access to the hyperstart VM agent to both the runtime and shim processes.
 Only a single instance of cc-proxy per host is necessary as it can be used for several different VMs.
